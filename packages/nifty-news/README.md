# NiFTy News DataModel

DataModel implementation of the **NiFTy News** schema and definition specified here).

## Installation

```sh
npm install -D @datamodels/nifty-news
```

## Rationale

The **NiFTy News** contains a News or Blogs's basic information designed around sustainability, confidentiality, and simplicity of asserting accuracy through the ability to attach IPFS data for use in NFT creation. Leveraging the schema.org/Events space simplifies the process, however we use it aware of the limitations in its current design.

https://www.foam.space/ is planned for integration in geospatially organizing this product

by building the product with BrightID compatibility we'll have a process for connecting content without risk of associating names or other biometric data that might compromise the safety of the news person

**Where and when things happen is the foundation stone of news**: The NiFTy News schema attempts to provide a reduced approach to the schema.org standard that, while inclusive and expansive, should probably be accorded a broader meta-data standard to then include mediawiki or other standard development products specific to the niche ecosystem.  and the whole damn thing should be done with silly little widgets

### [BasicProfile](./schemas/BasicProfile.json)

The Basic Profile schema defines the format of a document that contains the properties listed below. Properties not defined in the schema _cannot_ be included in the Basic Profile, however the schema can always be updated via a new CIP.
